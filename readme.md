First, ensure you have Node and npm downloaded. You can download from https://nodejs.org/en/download.

Then, run `npm i` in the terminal.

Next, run `node .\index.js` in the terminal.

Ensure your files are in the `files` directory with the versions of the file being in folders in that directory. Tests are already present there.

Select your file and file versions and the mappings will be outputted in words in the terminal.

Mappings will also be outputted in a file named `diffOutput.txt` in the outputs folder.
